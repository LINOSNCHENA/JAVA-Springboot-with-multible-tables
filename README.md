# 3 Data models,MSSQL,Postgresql, MySQL

Microservice application presents an interface API for connecting to three tables. The secondary tables are both linked to the master table by a single foreign key. GET operations are implemented and exploited using three databases with a uniform interface as JSON data connectivity.

## Technology Stack used

1. Spring-Boot
2. Database Option #1 (MySQL)
3. Database Option #2 (PostgreSQL) 
4. Database Option #3 (MSSQL)
5. Maven 

Note: The primary-key in MySQL and MSSQL is auto-increment while in the PostgreSQL it is serial. \
Need changes in the data model design as necessary respectively. 

## Running the application

To execute this application, use the following two command;

```
mvn clean package
